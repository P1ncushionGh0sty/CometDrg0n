> AuDHD + social anxiety, please be patient.

> I block/hide frequently, so if you end up getting hidden you were
rude/an asshole/annoying or you're the aforementioned DW or DSMP fan.

> I cuss a lot, so if you're uncomfortable w/ that grow up lol.

> Singlet, not in a system, feel free to educate me on systems if needed bc I'm kinda dumb.

> Please don't copy my skins.

> I don't have TT/TD but I do find it annoying to randomly get booped or covered/sat on.

> Usually hanging around the Pokémon, Undertale/Deltarune or Hazbin Hotel/Helluva Boss area.

> I'm exclusively on the 18+ server, I'm never on the safe server.

If you're not listed above feel free to interact and talk to me. :]

(** Roblox keeps taking over the Pokémon area and it is incredibly annoying.
There is plenty of open space elsewhere, go there instead.)
