> AuDHD + social anxiety, please be patient.

> I block/hide frequently, so if you end up getting hidden you were
rude/an asshole/annoying or you're the aforementioned DW or DSMP fan.

> I cuss a lot, so if you're uncomfortable w/ that grow up lol.

> I'm the complete opposite of cis and straight. I joke around w/ my friends
and we call eachother the F slur occasionally.

> Singlet, not in a system, feel free to educate me on systems if needed bc I'm kinda dumb.

> Please don't copy my skins or randomly come up to sit w/ or boop me, it's kinda fuckin annoying.

> Usually hanging around the Pokémon area,
my default skins are either Wallace, Silver, N, Red, or Piers.

> If I'm ever in the Creepypasta area I usually use
Gold/Ethan (Lost Silver), Steven (Strangled Red) or Glitchy Red.

> I'm exclusively on the 18+ server, I'm never on the safe server.
